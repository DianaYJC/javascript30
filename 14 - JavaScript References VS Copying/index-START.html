    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[2]='diana'
    // console.log(team, players)
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players1= players.slice()
    console.log(players1, players)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team1 = [].concat(players)
    console.log(team1, players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team2 = [...players]
    team2[2]='diana'
    console.log(team2,players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person1=person
    console.log(person1,person)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
     const person2= Object.assign({},person,{name:'diana',age:'35'})
     console.log(person2,person1)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person3={...person}
    console.log(person3,person)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, 
    // but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes ={
      name:'dian',
      class:'tech',
      age:"24",
      details:{
        hair:'black'
      }
    }
    // console.log(wes)
    // const wes1= Object.assign({},wes,{name:'peter',age:'15'})
    // console.log(wes,wes1)

    //see if it affect deep nest
    const wes1= Object.assign({},wes)
    wes1.details.hair="yellow"
    console.log(wes,wes1)
